# 🌦️ Weather App – API Practice Project

A simple weather application built with JavaScript, Webpack, and the Visual Crossing Weather API.
This project was created to practice working with REST APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamically updating the DOM with real-time weather data.

# 🚀 Live Overview

## This app allows users to:

 - 🔍 Search for any city

 - 🌡️ Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius

 - 🌤️ View current weather conditions

 - 🌧️ See precipitation and wind data

 - 📅 View a 5-day forecast

The application fetches real-time weather data from an external API and renders it dynamically on the page.
